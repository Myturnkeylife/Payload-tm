# Payload GenAI

This example demonstrates how to use generative AI in your [Payload](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload) application.

## Quick Start

To spin up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. First clone the repo
1. Then `cd YOUR_PROJECT_REPO && cp .env.example .env`
1. Next `yarn && yarn dev` (or `docker-compose up`, see [Docker](#docker))
1. Now `open http://localhost:3000/admin` to access the admin panel
1. Create your first admin user using the form on the page

That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your app.

## How it works

### Collections

See the [Collections](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections) docs for details on how to extend any of this functionality.

- #### Users

  The `users` collection is a default payload users collection.

- ### Prompt

  The `prompt` collection is for associating text with a GenAI purpose.

- ### Media

  The `media` collection is for uploading documents and associating a `transformer` and `prompts` for GenAI processing.

- ### Resource

  The `resource` collection is for associating operating information with a `knowledge-graph`, or a `transformer`.

- ### Transformer

  The `transformer` collection is for associating a model that can operate on vector representations of your documents. Vector representations can be stored as an `embedding` for future queries and GenAI analysis.

  Transformer model architecture was popularized by [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf) in 2017. They can be thought of as a sophisticated implementation of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). RNNs are both effective and efficent computation, you can [read a little more about them here](https://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/).

- ### Embedding

  The `embedding` collection is for vector representations of `prompts` and `media` that are generated by a `transformer`. Vector Embeddings are best stored and retrieved from databases tuned to operate on vector data.

  Databases that can do this are called **vector databases**. If you are new to vector databases, you can explore these examples, [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-vector-search), [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), [Milvus](https://milvus.io/), [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/) and [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/).

- ### Knowledge Graph

  The `knowledge-graph` collection is for identifying a knowledge graph to use for graph computations on documents. Knowledge graphs are best stored and retrieved from databases tuned to operate on graph structured data.

  Databases that can do this are called **graph databases**. If you are new to graph databases, you can explore these examples, [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), [NebulaGraph](https://www.nebula-graph.io/), [TigerGraph](https://www.tigergraph.com/), [JanusGraph](https://janusgraph.org/), [Amazon Neptune](https://aws.amazon.com/neptune/) and [Azure's Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/gremlin/introduction).

  The best graph databases for GenAI are knowledge graphs that can perform K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) queries as well as traditional graph queries by following [some transaction pattern](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8594636).

## Development

To spin up this example locally, follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start).

## Production

To run Payload in production, you need to build and serve the Admin panel. To do so, follow these steps:

1. First invoke the `payload build` script by running `yarn build` or `npm run build` in your project root. This creates a `./build` directory with a production-ready admin bundle.
1. Then run `yarn serve` or `npm run serve` to run Node in production and serve Payload from the `./build` directory.

### Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your project is to use [Payload Cloud](https://payloadcms.com/new/import), a one-click hosting solution to deploy production-ready instances of your Payload apps directly from your GitHub repo. You can also deploy your app manually, check out the [deployment documentation](https://payloadcms.com/docs/production/deployment) for full details.
