[Fields](../fields/overview) within the [Admin Panel](./overview) can be endlessly customized without affecting the underlying data structure. Everything from [Conditional Logic](#conditional-logic) to [Custom Field Components](#custom-field-components) can be configured to perfectly tailor the appearance and behavior of the interface for your editors.

For example, your app might need to render a specific interface that Payload does not inherently support, such as a color picker. To do this, you would simply replace the default [Text Field](../fields/text) input with some user-friendly UI that formats the data into a valid color value. Then, write a [Custom Validation](../fields/overview#validation) function could ensure the value is acceptable.

  <strong>Tip:</strong>
  Don't see a built-in field type that you need? Build it! Using a combination of [Field Validations](../fields/overview#validation)
  and [Custom Components](./components), you can override the entirety of how a component functions within the [Admin Panel](./overview) to effectively create your own field type.

## Admin Options

You can customize fields through the `admin` property of any [Field Config](../fields/overview):

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `condition`         | Programmatically show / hide fields based on other fields. [More details](../admin/fields#conditional-logic).                                                                                               |
| `components`        | All Field Components can be swapped out for [Custom Components](../admin/components) that you define. [More details](../admin/fields).                                                                             |
| `description`       | Helper text to display alongside the field to provide more information for the editor. [More details](../admin/fields#description).                                                                                                 |
| `position`          | Specify if the field should be rendered in the sidebar by defining `position: 'sidebar'`.                                                                                                                                        |
| `width`             | Restrict the width of a field. You can pass any string-based value here, be it pixels, percentages, etc. This property is especially useful when fields are nested within a `Row` type where they can be organized horizontally. |
| `style`             | Attach raw [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) style properties to the root DOM element of a field.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `className`         | Attach a [CSS class attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) to the root DOM element of a field.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `readOnly`          | Setting a field to `readOnly` has no effect on the API whatsoever but disables the admin component's editability to prevent editors from modifying the field's value.                                                            |
| `disabled`          | If a field is `disabled`, it is completely omitted from the Admin panel.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `disableBulkEdit`   | Set `disableBulkEdit` to `true` to prevent fields from appearing in the select options when making edits for multiple documents.                                                                                                 |
| `disableListColumn` | Set `disableListColumn` to `true` to prevent fields from appearing in the list view column selector.                                                                                                                             |
| `disableListFilter` | Set `disableListFilter` to `true` to prevent fields from appearing in the list view filter options.                                                                                                                              |
| `hidden`            | Will transform the field into a `hidden` input type. Its value will still submit with requests in the Admin Panel, but the field itself will not be visible to editors.        |

## Custom Components

Within the [Admin Panel](./overview), fields are rendered in three distinct places:

- [Field](#the-field-component) - The actual form field rendered in the Edit View.
- [Cell](#the-cell-component) - The table cell component rendered in the List View.
- [Filter](#the-filter-component) - The filter component rendered in the List View.

To easily swap in Field Components with your own, use the `admin.components` property of your [Field Config](../fields/overview):

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'

export const CollectionConfig: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  fields: [
    // ...
    {
      // ...
      admin: {
        components: {
          Field: MyCustomField, // highlight-line
        },
      },
    }
  ]
}
```

As an alternative to replacing the _entire_ Field component, you may want to keep the majority of the default component and only swap specific parts. This can be done by using the following options:

- [Label](#the-label-component) - The label component rendered in the Field Component.
- [Error](#the-error-component) - The error component rendered in the Field Component.
- [beforeInput](#beforeInput)* - An array of elements that will be added before the field's input.
- [afterInput](#afterInput)* - An array of elements that will be added after the field's input.

<i>
  \* **`beforeInput`** and **`afterInput`** are only supported in fields that don't contain other fields, with the exception of [UI](/docs/fields/ui) and [Rich Text](/docs/fields/rich-text).
</i>

<Banner type="warning">
  You can also pass a Custom Component to the `admin.description` property to render a custom description for the field. [More details](#the-description-component).
</Banner>

The following options are available:

| Component    | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Field`**  | The form field rendered in the Edit View. [More details](#field-component).                                                |
| **`Cell`**   | The table cell rendered in the List View. [More details](#cell-component).              |
| **`Filter`** | The filter component rendered in the List View. [More details](#filter-component). || Component         | Description                                                                                                     |
| **`Label`**       | Override the default Label in the Field Component. [More details](#label-component).                                    |
| **`Error`**       | Override the default Label in the Field Component. [More details](#error-component).                                    |
| **`beforeInput`** | An array of elements that will be added before `input`/`textarea` elements. [More details](#afterinput-and-beforeinput).|
| **`afterInput`**  | An array of elements that will be added after `input`/`textarea` elements. [More details](#afterinput-and-beforeinput). |

### The Field Component

[When building your own Custom Components](http://localhost:3000/docs/admin/components#building-custom-components) you can make use of a number of [Payload's built-in React Hooks](./hooks) to set data, react to the changes of other fields, get the id of the document or interact with a context from a custom provider.

#### Sending and receiving values from the form

When swapping out the `Field` component, you'll be responsible for sending and receiving the field's `value` from the form itself. To do so, import the `useField` hook as follows:

```tsx
'use client'
import { useField } from '@payloadcms/ui'

const CustomTextField: React.FC<{ path: string }> = ({ path }) => {
  // highlight-start
  const { value, setValue } = useField({ path })
  // highlight-end

  return <input onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} value={value} />
}
```

  components, including the <strong>useField</strong> hook, [click here](/docs/admin/hooks).

### The Cell Component

These are the props that will be passed to your custom Cell to use in your own components.

| Property         | Description                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`field`**      | An object that includes the field configuration.                  |
| **`colIndex`**   | A unique number for the column in the list.                       |
| **`collection`** | An object with the config of the Collection that the field is in. |
| **`cellData`**   | The data for the field that the cell represents.                  |
| **`rowData`**    | An object with all the field values for the row.                  |

#### Example

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import type { CellProps } from 'payload'
import './index.scss'

const baseClass = 'custom-cell'

const CustomCell: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {
  const { field, colIndex, collection, cellData, rowData } = props

  return <span className={baseClass}>{cellData}</span>
}
```

### The Label Component

These are the props that will be passed to your custom Label.

| Property       | Description                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`htmlFor`**  | Property used to set `for` attribute for label.                  |
| **`label`**    | Label value provided in field, it can be used with i18n.         |
| **`required`** | A boolean value that represents if the field is required or not. |

#### Example

```tsx
'use client'
import React from 'react'
import { useTranslation } from '@payloadcms/ui'
import { getTranslation } from '@payloadcms/translations'

type Props = {
  htmlFor?: string
  label?: Record<string, string> | false | string
  required?: boolean
}

const CustomLabel: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {
  const { htmlFor, label, required = false } = props

  const { i18n } = useTranslation()

  if (label) {
    return (
      <span>
        {getTranslation(label, i18n)}
        {required && <span className="required">*</span>}
      </span>
    )
  }

  return null
}
```

### The Error Component

These are the props that will be passed to your custom Error.

| Property        | Description                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`message`**   | The error message.                                            |
| **`showError`** | A boolean value that represents if the error should be shown. |

#### Example

```tsx
import React from 'react'

type Props = {
  message: string
  showError?: boolean
}

const CustomError: React.FC<Props> = (props) => {
  const { message, showError } = props

  if (showError) {
    return <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{message}</p>
  } else return null
}
```

### afterInput and beforeInput

With these properties you can add multiple components before and after the input element. For example, you can add an absolutely positioned button to clear the current field value.

#### Example

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import type { Field } from 'payload/types'

import './style.scss'

const ClearButton: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        /* ... */
      }}
    >
      X
    </button>
  )
}

const titleField: Field = {
  name: 'title',
  type: 'text',
  admin: {
    components: {
      afterInput: [ClearButton],
    },
  },
}

export default titleField
```

### The Description Component

The `description` property is used to provide additional information to the editor about a field. A description can be configured in three ways.

- As a string
- As a function which returns a string
- As a React component

Functions are called with an optional argument object with the following shape, and React components are rendered with the following props:

- `path` - the path of the field
- `value` - the current value of the field

As shown above, you can simply provide a string that will show by the field, but there are use cases where you may want to create some dynamic feedback. By using a function or a component for the `description` property you can provide realtime feedback as the user interacts with the form.

**Function Example:**

```ts
{
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'message',
      type: 'text',
      maxLength: 20,
      admin: {
        description: ({ path, value }) =>
          `${typeof value === 'string' ? 20 - value.length : '20'} characters left (field: ${path})`,
      },
    },
  ]
}
```

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  The `description` property is top-level of the [Field Config](../fields/overview), not within the `admin` object.
</Banner>

This example will display the number of characters allowed as the user types.

**Component Example:**

```ts
{
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'message',
      type: 'text',
      maxLength: 20,
      admin: {
        description:
          ({ path, value }) => (
            <div>
              Character count:
              {' '}
              { value?.length || 0 }
               (field: {path})
            </div>
          )
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This component will count the number of characters entered, as well as display the path of the field.

## Conditional Logic

You can show and hide fields based on what other fields are doing by utilizing conditional logic on a field by field basis. The `condition` property on a field's admin config accepts a function which takes three arguments:

- `data` - the entire document's data that is currently being edited
- `siblingData` - only the fields that are direct siblings to the field with the condition
- `{ user }` - the final argument is an object containing the currently authenticated user

The `condition` function should return a boolean that will control if the field should be displayed or not.

**Example:**

```ts
{
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'enableGreeting',
      type: 'checkbox',
      defaultValue: false,
    },
    {
      name: 'greeting',
      type: 'text',
      admin: {
        // highlight-start
        condition: (data, siblingData, { user }) => {
          if (data.enableGreeting) {
            return true
          } else {
            return false
          }
        },
        // highlight-end
      },
    },
  ]
}
```
