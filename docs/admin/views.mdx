### Root

You can easily swap entire views with your own by using the `admin.components.views` property. At the root level, Payload renders the following views by default, all of which can be overridden:

| Property        | Description                                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Account`**   | The Account view is used to show the currently logged in user's Account page. |
| **`Dashboard`** | The main landing page of the [Admin Panel](./overview).                                     |

To swap out any of these views, simply pass in your custom component to the `admin.components.views` property of your Payload config. For example:

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Account: MyCustomAccountView,
        Dashboard: MyCustomDashboardView,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

For more granular control, pass a configuration object instead. Payload exposes the following properties for each view:

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`Component`** \* | Pass in the component that should be rendered when a user navigates to this route.                                                                                                         |
| **`path`** \*      | Any valid URL path or array of paths that [`path-to-regexp`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/path-to-regex) understands.                                                                     |
| **`exact`**        | Boolean. When true, will only match if the path matches the `usePathname()` exactly.                                                                                                     |
| **`strict`**       | When true, a path that has a trailing slash will only match a location.pathname with a trailing slash. This has no effect when there are additional URL segments in the location.pathname. |
| **`sensitive`**    | When true, will match if the path is case sensitive.                                                                                                                                       |

_\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._

#### Adding new root views

To add a _new_ view to the [Admin Panel](./overview), simply add another key to the `views` object with at least a `path` and `Component` property. For example:

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        MyCustomView: {
          Component: MyCustomView,
          path: '/my-custom-view',
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  <br />
  Routes are cascading. This means that unless explicitly given the `exact` property, they will
  match on URLs that simply _start_ with the route's path. This is helpful when creating catch-all
  routes in your application. Alternatively, you could define your nested route _before_ your parent
  route.

### Collections

To swap out entire views on collections, you can use the `admin.components.views` property on the collection's config. Payload renders the following views by default, all of which can be overridden:

| Property   | Description                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Edit`** | The Edit view is used to edit a single document for a given collection.   |
| **`List`** | The List view is used to show a list of documents for a given collection. |

To swap out any of these views, simply pass in your custom component to the `admin.components.views` property of your Payload config. This will replace the entire view, including the page breadcrumbs, title, tabs, etc, _as well as all nested routes_.

```ts
// Collection.ts
{
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Edit: MyCustomEditView,
        List: MyCustomListView,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**Customizing Nested Views within 'Edit' in Collections**

The `Edit` view in collections consists of several nested views, each serving a unique purpose. You can customize these nested views using the `admin.components.views.Edit` property in the collection's configuration. This approach allows you to replace specific nested views while keeping the overall structure of the `Edit` view intact, including the page breadcrumbs, title, tabs, etc.

Here's an example of how you can customize nested views within the `Edit` view in collections, including the use of the `actions` property:

```ts
// Collection.ts
{
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Edit: {
          Default: {
            Component: MyCustomDefaultTab,
            actions: [CollectionEditButton], // Custom actions for the default edit view
          },
          API: {
            Component: MyCustomAPIView,
            actions: [CollectionAPIButton], // Custom actions for API view
          },
          LivePreview: {
            Component: MyCustomLivePreviewView,
            actions: [CollectionLivePreviewButton], // Custom actions for Live Preview
          },
          Version: {
            Component: MyCustomVersionView,
            actions: [CollectionVersionButton], // Custom actions for Version view
          },
          Versions: {
            Component: MyCustomVersionsView,
            actions: [CollectionVersionsButton], // Custom actions for Versions view
          },
        },
        List: {
          actions: [CollectionListButton],
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

**Adding New Tabs to 'Edit' View**

You can also add _new_ tabs to the `Edit` view by adding another key to the `components.views.Edit[key]` object with a `path` and `Component` property. See [Custom Tabs](#custom-tabs) for more information.

### Globals

To swap out views for globals, you can use the `admin.components.views` property on the global's config. Payload renders the following views by default, all of which can be overridden:

| Property   | Description                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Edit`** | The Edit view is used to edit a single document for a given Global. |

To swap out any of these views, simply pass in your custom component to the `admin.components.views` property of your Payload config. This will replace the entire view, including the page breadcrumbs, title, and tabs, _as well as all nested views_.

```ts
// Global.ts
{
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Edit: MyCustomEditView,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

For help on how to build your own custom view components, see [Building Custom View Components](#building-custom-view-components).

**Customizing Nested Views within 'Edit' in Globals**

Similar to collections, Globals allow for detailed customization within the `Edit` view. This includes the ability to swap specific nested views while maintaining the overall structure of the `Edit` view. You can use the `admin.components.views.Edit` property in the Globals configuration to achieve this, and this will only replace the nested view, leaving the page breadcrumbs, title, and tabs intact.

Here's how you can customize nested views within the `Edit` view in Globals, including the use of the `actions` property:

```ts
// Global.ts
{
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Edit: {
          Default: {
            Component: MyCustomGlobalDefaultTab,
            actions: [GlobalEditButton], // Custom actions for the default edit view
          },
          API: {
            Component: MyCustomGlobalAPIView,
            actions: [GlobalAPIButton], // Custom actions for API view
          },
          LivePreview: {
            Component: MyCustomGlobalLivePreviewView,
            actions: [GlobalLivePreviewButton], // Custom actions for Live Preview
          },
          Version: {
            Component: MyCustomGlobalVersionView,
            actions: [GlobalVersionButton], // Custom actions for Version view
          },
          Versions: {
            Component: MyCustomGlobalVersionsView,
            actions: [GlobalVersionsButton], // Custom actions for Versions view
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

You can also add _new_ tabs to the `Edit` view by adding another key to the `components.views.Edit[key]` object with a `path` and `Component` property. See [Custom Tabs](#custom-tabs) for more information.

### Custom Tabs

You can easily swap individual collection or global edit views. To do this, pass an _object_ to the `admin.components.views.Edit` property of the config. Payload renders the following views by default, all of which can be overridden:

| Property          | Description                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Default`**     | The Default view is the primary view in which your document is edited.                                                      |
| **`Versions`**    | The Versions view is used to view the version history of a single document. [More details](../versions)                     |
| **`Version`**     | The Version view is used to view a single version of a single document for a given collection. [More details](../versions). |
| **`API`**         | The API view is used to display the REST API JSON response for a given document.                                            |
| **`LivePreview`** | The LivePreview view is used to display the Live Preview interface. [More details](../live-preview)                         |

Here is an example:

```ts
// Collection.ts or Global.ts
export const MyCollection: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'my-collection',
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Edit: {
          // You can also define `components.views.Edit` as a component, this will override _all_ nested views
          Default: MyCustomDefaultTab,
          Versions: MyCustomVersionsTab,
          Version: MyCustomVersionTab,
          API: MyCustomAPITab,
          LivePreview: MyCustomLivePreviewTab,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

To add a _new_ tab to the `Edit` view, simply add another key to `components.views.Edit[key]` with at least a `path` and `Component` property. For example:

```ts
// `Collection.ts` or `Global.ts`
export const MyCollection: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'my-collection',
  admin: {
    components: {
      views: {
        Edit: {
          MyCustomTab: {
            Component: MyCustomTab,
            path: '/my-custom-tab',
            // You an swap the entire tab component out for your own
            Tab: MyCustomTab,
          },
          AnotherCustomView: {
            Component: AnotherCustomView,
            path: '/another-custom-view',
            // Or you can use the default tab component and just pass in your own label and href
            Tab: {
              label: 'Another Custom View',
              href: '/another-custom-view',
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Building Custom View Components

Your custom view components will be provided with the following props:

| Prop                    | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`user`**              | The currently logged in user. Will be `null` if no user is logged in.        |
| **`canAccessAdmin`** \* | If the currently logged in user is allowed to access the [Admin Panel](./overview) or not. |

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  <br />
  It's up to you to secure your custom views. If your view requires a user to be logged in or to
  have certain access rights, you should handle that within your view component yourself.
</Banner>

### Examples

You can find examples of custom views in the [Payload source code `/test/admin/components/views` folder](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/test/admin/components/views). There, you'll find two custom views:

1. A custom view that uses the `DefaultTemplate`, which is the built-in Payload template that displays the sidebar and "eyebrow nav"
1. A custom view that uses the `MinimalTemplate` - which is just a centered template used for things like logging in or out

To see how to pass in your custom views to create custom views of your own, take a look at the `admin.components.views` property of the [Payload test admin config](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/blob/main/test/admin/config.ts).
