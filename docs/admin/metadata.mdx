Every page within the Admin Panel automatically receives auto-generated metadata without any additional work, including a dynamic page title, description, og:image and more. Metadata cascades down from the root of the Admin Panel to the individual document level, allowing you to customize metadata within the Admin Panel at a high level of granularity.

Within the Admin Panel, metadata can be customized at the following levels:

- Root Metadata
- Collection Metadata
- Global Metadata
- Document Metadata
- Custom View Metadata

All of these types of metadata share a similar structure, with a few key differences on the Root level. To customize metadata, consult the list of available scopes. Determine the one that corresponds to what you are trying to accomplish, then author your metadata accordingly.

## Root Metadata

Root Metadata is the metadata that is applied to the entire Admin Panel. This is where you can supply app-wide metadata, such as a title suffix, favicon, and more.

To customize Root Metadata, use the `admin.meta` key in your Payload Config:

```ts
// payload.config.js
{
  admin: {
    meta: {
      title: 'My Admin Panel',
      description: 'The best admin panel in the world',
      icons: [
        {
          rel: 'icon',
          type: 'image/png',
          href: '/favicon.png',
        },
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

The following options are available for Root Metadata:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | `string` | The title of the Admin Panel. |
| `description` | `string` | The description of the Admin Panel. |
| `defaultOGImageType` | `dynamic | static | off` | The type of default OG image to use. If set to `dynamic`, Payload will use Next.js image generation to create an image with the title of the page. If set to `static`, Payload will use the `defaultOGImage` URL. If set to `off`, Payload will not generate an OG image. |
| `icons` | `IconConfig[]` | An array of icon objects. [More details](#icons) |
| `keywords` | `string` | A comma-separated list of keywords to include in the metadata of the Admin Panel. |
| `openGraph` | `OpenGraphConfig` | An object containing Open Graph metadata. [More details](#open-graph) |
| `titleSuffix` | `string` | A suffix to append to the end of the title of every page. Defaults to "- Payload". |

## Icons

The Icons Config corresponds to the `<link>` tags that are used to specify icons for the Admin Panel. The `icons` key is an array of objects, each of which represents an icon.

To customize icons, use the `icons` key within the `admin.meta` object in your Payload Config:

```ts
// payload.config.js
{
  // ...
  admin: {
    meta: {
      icons: [
        {
          rel: 'icon',
          type: 'image/png',
          href: '/favicon.png',
        },
        {
          rel: 'apple-touch-icon',
          type: 'image/png',
          href: '/apple-touch-icon.png',
        },
      ],
    },
  },
}
```

The following options are available for Icons:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rel` | `string` | The HTML `rel` attribute of the icon. |
| `type` | `string` | The MIME type of the icon. |
| `color` | `string` | The color of the icon. |
| `fetchPriority` | `string` | The [fetch priority](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/fetchPriority) of the icon. |
| `media` | `string` | The [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) of the icon. |
| `sizes` | `string` | The [sizes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/sizes) of the icon. |
| `url` | `string` | The URL pointing the resource of the icon. |

## Open Graph

Open Graph metadata is a set of tags that are used to control how URLs are displayed when shared on social media platforms. Open Graph metadata is automatically generated by Payload, but can be customized at the Root level.

To customize Open Graph metadata, use the `openGraph` key within the `admin.meta` object in your Payload Config:

```ts
// payload.config.js
{
  // ...
  admin: {
    meta: {
      openGraph: {
        description: 'The best admin panel in the world',
        images: [
          {
            url: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',
            width: 800,
            height: 600,
          },
        ],
        siteName: 'Payload',
        title: 'My Admin Panel',
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The following options are available for Open Graph Metadata:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `description` | `string` | The description of the Admin Panel. |
| `images` | `OGImageConfig | OGImageConfig[]` | An array of image objects. |
| `siteName` | `string` | The name of the site. |
| `title` | `string` | The title of the Admin Panel. |
