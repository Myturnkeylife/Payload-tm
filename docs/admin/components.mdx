The [Payload Admin Panel](./overview) is designed to be as minimal and straightforward as possible to allow for both easy customization and full control over the UI. In order for Payload to support this level of customization, Payload provides a pattern for you to supply your own React components through your [Payload Config](../configuration/overview).

All Custom Components in Payload are [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default, with the exception of [Custom Providers](#custom-providers). This enables the use of the [Local API](../local-api) directly in the front-end. Custom Components are available for nearly every part of the Admin Panel for extreme granularity and control.

<Banner type="success">
  <strong>Note:</strong>
  Client Components continue to be fully supported. To use Client Components in your app, simply import them into a Server Component and render them. Ensure your Client Component includes the `use client` directive and is not passed any [non-serializable props](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/use-client#serializable-types).
</Banner>

To swap in your own Custom Component, consult the list of available components below. Determine the scope that corresponds to what you are trying to accomplish, then [author your React component(s)](#building-custom-components) accordingly.

## Custom Root Components

Root Components are those that effect the Admin Panel generally. You can override Root Components through the `admin.components` property of the [Payload Config](../getting-started/overview).

Here is an example showing what it might look like to swap out Root Components for your own Custom Components. See [Building Custom Components](#building-custom-components) for exact details on how to build them:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

import { MyCustomLogo } from './MyCustomLogo'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  admin: {
    components: {
      graphics: {
        Logo: MyCustomLogo, // highlight-line
      },
    },
  },
})
```

The following options are available:

| Path                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`Nav`**             | Contains the sidebar / mobile menu in its entirety.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`BeforeNavLinks`**  | An array of Custom Components to inject into the built-in Nav, _before_ the links themselves.                                                                                                                       |
| **`AfterNavLinks`**   | An array of Custom Components to inject into the built-in Nav, _after_ the links.                                                                                                                                   |
| **`BeforeDashboard`** | An array of Custom Components to inject into the built-in Dashboard, _before_ the default dashboard contents.                                                                                                       |

| **`AfterLogin`**      | An array of Custom Components to inject into the built-in Login, _after_ the default login form.                                                                                                                    |
| **`logout.Button`**   | The button displayed in the sidebar that logs the user out.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **`graphics.Icon`**   | The simplified logo used in contexts like the the `Nav` component.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **`graphics.Logo`**   | The full logo used in contexts like the `Login` view.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **`providers`**       | Custom [React Context](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context) providers that will wrap the entire [Admin Panel](./overview). [More](#custom-providers).                                       |
| **`actions`**         | An array of Custom Components to be rendered in the header of the [Admin Panel](./overview), providing additional interactivity and functionality.                                                                  |

<Banner type="success">
  <strong>Note:</strong> You can also use the `admin.components` property on any Collection or Global config to set [Custom Collection Components](#custom-collection-components) and [Custom Global Components](#custom-global-components), respectively.
</Banner>

### Custom Providers

You can add additional [React Context](https://react.dev/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context) to any Payload app through Custom Providers. As you add more and more Custom Components to your [Admin Panel](./overview), you may want to share state across all of them.

To do this, simply add `admin.components.providers` to your config:

```tsx
'use client'
import React, { createContext, useContext } from 'react'

const MyCustomContext = React.createContext(myCustomValue)

export const MyProvider: React.FC = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <MyCustomContext.Provider value={myCustomValue}>
      {children}
    </MyCustomContext.Provider>
  )
}

export const useMyCustomContext = () => useContext(MyCustomContext)
```

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Reminder:</strong> Custom Providers are by definition Client Components. This means they must include the `use client` directive at the top of their files and cannot use server-only code.
</Banner>

## Custom Collection Components

Collection Components are those that effect [Collection](../configuration/collections)-specific UI within the [Admin Panel](./overview). You can override Collection Components through the `admin.components` property on any [Collection Config](../configuration/collections).

Here is an example showing what it might look like to swap out Collection Components for your own Custom Components. See [Building Custom Components](#building-custom-components) for exact details on how to build them:

```ts
import type { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload/types'
import { CustomSaveButton } from './CustomSaveButton'

export const MyCollection: SanitizedCollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'my-collection',
  admin: {
    components: {
      edit: {
        SaveButton: CustomSaveButton, // highlight-line
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
}
```

The following options are available:

| Path                       | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`BeforeList`**           | Array of components to inject _before_ the built-in List view                                                          |
| **`BeforeListTable`**      | Array of components to inject _before_ the built-in List view's table                                                  |
| **`AfterList`**            | Array of components to inject _after_ the built-in List view                                                           |
| **`AfterListTable`**       | Array of components to inject _after_ the built-in List view's table                                                   |
| **`edit.SaveButton`**      | Replace the default `Save` button with a custom component. Drafts must be disabled                                     |
| **`edit.SaveDraftButton`** | Replace the default `Save Draft` button with a custom component. Drafts must be enabled and autosave must be disabled. |
| **`edit.PublishButton`**   | Replace the default `Publish` button with a custom component. Drafts must be enabled.                                  |
| **`edit.PreviewButton`**   | Replace the default `Preview` button with a custom component.                                                          |
| **`views`**                | Override or create new views within the [Admin Panel](./overview). [More](./views).                                     |

## Custom Global Components

Global Components are those that effect [Global](../configuration/globals)-specific UI within the [Admin Panel](./overview). You can override Global Components through the `admin.components` property on any [Global Config](../configuration/globals).

Here is an example showing what it might look like to swap out Global Components for your own Custom Components. See [Building Custom Components](#building-custom-components) for exact details on how to build them:

```ts
import type { SanitizedGlobalConfig } from 'payload/types'
import { CustomSaveButton } from './CustomSaveButton'

export const MyGlobal: SanitizedGlobalConfig = {
  slug: 'my-global',
  admin: {
    components: {
      elements: {
        SaveButton: CustomSaveButton, // highlight-line
      },
    },
  },
  // ...
}
```

The following options are available:

| Path                           | Description                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`elements.SaveButton`**      | Replace the default `Save` button with a custom component. Drafts must be disabled.                                    |
| **`elements.SaveDraftButton`** | Replace the default `Save Draft` button with a custom component. Drafts must be enabled and autosave must be disabled. |
| **`elements.PublishButton`**   | Replace the default `Publish` button with a custom component. Drafts must be enabled.                                  |
| **`elements.PreviewButton`**   | Replace the default `Preview` button with a custom component.                                                          |
| **`views`**                    | Override or create new views within the [Admin Panel](./overview). [More](./views).                                     |

## Building Custom Components

All Custom Components in Payload are [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components) by default, with the exception of [Custom Providers](#custom-providers). This enables the use of the [Local API](../local-api) directly in the front-end.

To do this, we first need to "get Payload". This is done by importing `getPayloadHMR` from `@payloadcms/next` and passing it your Payload config. This function will return a cached, HMR-enabled Payload instance that you can use to interact with your data:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { getPayloadHMR } from '@payloadcms/next'
import config from '../payload.config'

export default async function MyComponent() {
  const payload = await getPayloadHMR({ config }) // highlight-line

  const page = await payload.findByID({
    collection: 'pages',
    id: '123'
  })

  return (
    <p>{page.title}</p>
  )
}
```

<Banner type="success">
  See [Root Components](#custom-root-components), [Collection Components](#custom-collection-components), and [Global Components](#custom-global-components) for a complete list of all available components.
</Banner>

#### Client Components

To use client-side code such as `useState` or the `window` object, simply define your component in a new file with the `use client` directive at the top:

```tsx
'use client'
import React, { useState } from 'react'

export const MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  )
}
```

Then simply import and render your Client Component within your Server Component:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { MyClientComponent } from './MyClientComponent'

export default function MyServerComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyClientComponent />
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Using Hooks

To make it easier to build your Custom Components, you can use [Payload's built-in React Hooks](./hooks) on the client. For example, you might want to interact with one of Payload's many React Contexts:

```tsx
'use client'
import React from 'react'
import { useDocumentInfo } from '@payloadcms/ui'

export const MyClientComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { slug } = useDocumentInfo()

  return (
    <p>{`Entity slug: ${slug}`}</p>
  )
}
```

<Banner type="success">
  See the [Hooks](./hooks) documentation for a full list of available hooks.
</Banner>

#### Getting the Current Language

When developing Custom Components you can support multiple languages to be consistent with Payload's i18n support. The best way to do this is to add your translation resources to the [i18n configuration](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/i18n) and import `useTranslation` from `@payloadcms/ui/providers/Translation` in your components.

For example:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useTranslation } from '@payloadcms/ui/providers/Translation'

const CustomComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation() // highlight-line

  return (
    <ul>
      <li>{t('namespace1:key', { variable: 'value' })}</li>
      <li>{t('namespace2:key', { variable: 'value' })}</li>
      <li>{i18n.language}</li>
    </ul>
  )
}
```

#### Getting the Current Locale

In any custom component you can get the selected locale with `useLocale` hook. `useLocale` returns the full locale object, consisting of a `label`, `rtl`(right-to-left) property, and then `code`. Here is a simple example:

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useLocale } from '@payloadcms/ui'

const Greeting: React.FC = () => {
  const locale = useLocale() // highlight-line

  const trans = {
    en: 'Hello',
    es: 'Hola',
  }

  return <span> {trans[locale.code]} </span>
}
```

## Styling Custom Components

Payload exposes its [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) so that you can style your Custom Components similarly to Payload's built-in styling. This will ensure that your Custom Components match the existing design system, and so that they automatically adapt to any theme changes.

For example, to colorize your component you can use the following CSS:

```scss
.my-component {
  background-color: var(--theme-elevation-500);
}
```

Then, simply import your `.css` or `.scss` file into your Custom Component:

```tsx
import './index.scss'

export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="my-component">
      My Custom Component
    </div>
  )
}
```

<Banner type="success">
  You can also apply global CSS to easily control or override app-wide styles, or drill into Payload's own component styles. More on that [here](./customizing-css).
</Banner>

Payload also exports its [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) variables and mixins for reuse if you prefer that. To make use of Payload's SCSS library directly in your Custom Components, you can import it as follows:

```scss
@import '~payload/scss';
```
