Lexical features are self-contained, which means every piece of functionality for your feature is defined in two interfaces:
one for server-only functionality, and another one for client-only functionality.

Within payload, the convention is to name those feature.server.ts and feature.client.ts. The "main" feature resides in feature.server.ts which is
what the user will import, and the client feature is imported by the server feature and server-rendered there. That way, we still maintain a clear
boundary between server and client code, but everything your feature needs is defined in basically one place. Whether it's a toolbar entry, a button,
a new node, literally anything, you can semantically contain it within one feature.

## Server Feature

In order to get started with a new feature, you should start with the server feature which is the entry-point of your feature.

### Example myFeature/feature.server.ts:

```ts

```
