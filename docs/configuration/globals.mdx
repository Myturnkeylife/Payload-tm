Payload Globals are in many ways similar to [Collections](../configuration/collections). The big difference is that Collections will potentially contain _many_ documents, while a Global is a "one-off". Globals are perfect for things like header nav, site-wide banner alerts, app-wide localized strings, and other "global" data that your site or app might rely on.

As with Collection configs, it's often best practice to write your Globals in separate files and then import them into the main Payload Config.

## Config Options

```ts
import { GlobalConfig } from 'payload'

const Nav: GlobalConfig = {
  slug: 'nav',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'items',
      type: 'array',
      required: true,
      maxRows: 8,
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'page',
          type: 'relationship',
          relationTo: 'pages', // "pages" is the slug of an existing collection
          required: true,
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}

export default Nav
```

_\* An asterisk denotes that a property is required._


### Access Control

As with Collections, you can specify extremely granular access control (what users can do with this Global) on a Global-by-Global basis. However, Globals only have `update` and `read` access control due to their nature of only having one document. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](../access-control/overview) docs.

### Hooks

Globals also fully support a smaller subset of Hooks. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](../hooks/overview) documentation.

### Admin Options

You can customize the way that the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) behaves on a Global-by-Global basis.

To configure Collection Admin Options, use the `admin` property in your Global Config:

```ts
import { GlobalConfig } from 'payload'

const MyGlobal: GlobalConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: { // highlight-line
    // ...
  },
}
```

The following options are available:

| Option        | Description                                                                                                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `group`       | Text used as a label for grouping collection and global links together in the navigation.                                         |
| `hidden`      | Set to true or a function, called with the current user, returning true to exclude this global from navigation and admin routing. |
| `components`  | Swap in your own React components to be used within this Global. [More details](../admin/components#globals).                           |
| `preview`     | Function to generate a preview URL within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) for this global that can point to your app. [More details](#preview).           |
| `livePreview` | Enable real-time editing for instant visual feedback of your front-end application. [More details](../live-preview/overview).          |
| `hideAPIURL`  | Hides the "API URL" meta field while editing documents within this collection.                                                    |
| `meta`        | Metadata overrides to apply to the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview). Included properties are `description` and `openGraph`.       |

### Preview

If the `admin.preview` property is specified, the Preview Button will automatically appear in the corresponding Global's Edit View. This will allow editors to visit the frontend of your app and preview potentially unpublished changes.

To configure the Preview Button, use the `admin.preview` property in your Global Config:

```ts
import { GlobalConfig } from 'payload'

export const MyGlobal: GlobalConfig = {
  slug: 'my-global',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'slug',
      type: 'text',
      required: true,
    },
  ],
  admin: {
    preview: (doc, { locale }) => {
      if (doc?.slug) {
        return `https://bigbird.com/preview/${doc.slug}?locale=${locale}`
      }

      return null
    },
  },
}
```

The preview function receives two arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `doc` | The document being edited |
| `ctx` | An object containing `locale` and `token` properties. The `token` is the currently logged-in user's JWT. |

## TypeScript

You can import global types as follows:

```ts
import { GlobalConfig } from 'payload'

// This is the type used for incoming global configs.
// Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required.
```

```ts
import { SanitizedGlobalConfig } from 'payload/types'

// This is the type used after an incoming global config is fully sanitized.
// Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.
```
