A Collection is a group of records, called Documents, that all share a common schema. You can define as many Collections as your application needs. Each Collection saves to the [Database](../database/overview) based on the [Fields](../fields/overview) that you define, and automatically generates the [Local API](../local-api/overview), [REST API](../rest-api/overview), and [GraphQL API](../graphql/overview) to manage your Documents.

Collections are also the primary way to achieve [Authentication](../authentication/overview) in Payload. By defining a Collection with `auth` options, that Collection receives additional operations to support user authentication.

Collections are the primary way to structure recurring data in your application, such as users, products, pages, posts, and other types of content that you might want to manage. Each Collection can have its own unique [Access Control](../access-control/overview), [Hooks](../hooks/overview), [Admin Options](#admin-options), and more.

To define a Collection Config, use the `collection` property in your [Payload Config](./overview):

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // ...
  collections: [ // highlight-line
    // Your Collections go here
  ],
})
```

  <strong>Tip:</strong>
  If your Collection is only ever meant to contain a single Document, consider using a [Global](./globals) instead.

## Config Options

It's often best practice to write your Collections in separate files and then import them into the main [Payload Config](../overview).

Here is what a simple Collection Config might look like:

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'title',
      type: 'text',
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fields

Fields define the schema of the Documents within a Collection. To learn more, go to the [Fields](../fields/overview) documentation.

### Access Control

Access Control determines what a user can and cannot do with any given Document. To learn more, go to the [Access Control](../access-control/overview) docs.

### Hooks

Hooks allow you to tie into the lifecycle of your Documents so you can execute your own logic during specific events. To learn more, go to the [Hooks](../hooks/overview) documentation.

### Admin Options

You can customize the way that the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview) behaves on a Collection-by-Collection basis.

To configure Admin Options for Collections, use the `admin` property in your Collection Config:

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: { // highlight-line
    // ...
  },
}
```

The following options are available:

| Option                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **`hidden`**                     | Set to true or a function, called with the current user, returning true to exclude this Collection from navigation and admin routing.                                                                 |

| **`useAsTitle`**                 | Specify a top-level field to use for a document title throughout the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview). If no field is defined, the ID of the document is used as the title.                                                |
| **`description`**                | Text or React component to display below the Collection label in the List View to give editors more information.                                                                                      |
| **`defaultColumns`**             | Array of field names that correspond to which columns to show by default in this Collection's List View.                                                                                              |

| **`listSearchableFields`**       | Specify which fields should be searched in the List search view. [More details](#list-searchable-fields).                                                                                                      |
| **`pagination`**             | Set pagination-specific options for this Collection. [More details](#pagination).                                                                                                                              |

#### Preview

It is possible to display a Preview Button in the Admin Panel within the Edit View. This will allow editors to visit the frontend of your app the corresponds to the document they are actively editing. This way they can preview the latest, potentially unpublished changes.

To configure the Preview Button, set the `admin.preview` property to a function in your Collection Config:

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-start
    preview: (doc, { locale }) => {
      if (doc?.slug) {
        return `/${doc.slug}?locale=${locale}`
      }

      return null
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
}
```

The preview function receives two arguments:

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`doc`** | The document being edited |
| **`ctx`** | An object containing `locale` and `token` properties. The `token` is the currently logged-in user's JWT. |

  <strong>Reminder:</strong>
  For fully working example of this, check of the official [Draft Preview Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/draft-preview) in the [Examples Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples).
</Banner>

#### Pagination

All Collections receive their own List View which displays a paginated list of documents that can be sorted and filtered. The pagination behavior of the List View can be customized on a per-Collection basis.

To configure pagination options, use the `admin.pagination` property in your Collection Config:

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-start
    pagination: {
      defaultLimit: 10,
      limits: [10, 20, 50],
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
}
```

The following options are available:

| Option         | Description                                                                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `defaultLimit` | Integer that specifies the default per-page limit that should be used. Defaults to 10.              |
| `limits`       | Provide an array of integers to use as per-page options for admins to choose from in the List View. |

#### List Searchable Fields

In the List View, there is a "search" box that allows you to quickly find a document through a simple text search. By default, it searches on the ID field. If defined, the `admin.useAsTitle` field is used. Or, you can explicitly define which fields to search based on the needs of your application.

To define which fields should be searched, use the `admin.listSearchableFields` property in your Collection Config:

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  // ...
  admin: {
    // highlight-start
    listSearchableFields: ['title', 'slug'],
    // highlight-end
  },
}
```

<Banner type="warning">
  <strong>Tip:</strong>
  If you are adding `listSearchableFields`, make sure you index each of these fields so your admin queries can remain performant.
</Banner>

## TypeScript

You can import Collection types as follows:

```ts
import { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

// This is the type used for incoming Collection configs.
// Only the bare minimum properties are marked as required.
```

```ts
import { SanitizedCollectionConfig } from 'payload'

// This is the type used after an incoming Collection config is fully sanitized.
// Generally, this is only used internally by Payload.
```
