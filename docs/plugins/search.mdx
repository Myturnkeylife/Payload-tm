[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@payloadcms/plugin-search)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@payloadcms/plugin-search)

This plugin generates records of your documents that are extremely fast to search on. It does this by creating a new `search` collection that is indexed in the database using only search-critical data that you define. Records are automatically created, synced, and deleted behind-the-scenes as you manage your application's documents.

You can then use all the normal Payload APIs like [REST](https://payloadcms.com/docs/rest-api), [Local API](https://payloadcms.com/docs/local-api), or [GraphQL](https://payloadcms.com/docs/graphql) to query search results just as you would any other document. You can even prioritize search results by defining a custom priority for each collection. For example, you may want to prioritize blog posts over pages.

This is a great way to implement a fast, immersive search experience for something like a search bar in a front-end application. Many applications may not need the power and complexity of a third-party service like Algolia or ElasticSearch. This plugin provides a first-party alternative that is easy to set up and runs entirely on your own database.

##### Core Features

- Automatically adds an indexed `search` collection to your database
- Automatically creates, syncs, and deletes search records as you manage your documents
- Saves only search-critical data that you define (e.g. title, excerpt, etc.)
- Allows you to query search results using first-party Payload APIs
- Allows you to easily prioritize search results

## Installation

Install the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), [NPM](https://npmjs.com), or [PNPM](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
  yarn add @payloadcms/plugin-search
```

## Basic Usage

In the `plugins` array of your [Payload config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview), call the plugin with [options](#options):

```js
import { buildConfig } from 'payload/config'
import search from '@payloadcms/plugin-search'

const config = buildConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      slug: 'pages',
      fields: [],
    },
    {
      slug: 'posts',
      fields: [],
    },
  ],
  plugins: [
    search({
      collections: ['pages', 'posts'],
      defaultPriorities: {
        pages: 10,
        posts: 20,
      },
    }),
  ],
})

export default config
```

### Options

#### `collections`

The `collections` property is an array of collections slugs to enable sync-to-search. Enabled collections receive a `beforeChange` and `afterDelete` hook that creates, syncs, and deleted the document to its related search document as it changes over time, and also an `afterDelete` hook that deletes.

#### `defaultPriorities`

The default priorities first set on `create` operations. Send an object of collection slugs, and set them to either a number or a function.

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  searchPlugin({
    defaultPriorities: {
      pages: ({ doc }) => (doc.title.startsWith('Hello, world!') ? 1 : 10),
      posts: 20,
    },
    // ...
    // See below for all options
  }),
}
```

#### `searchOverrides`

Override anything on the search collection by sending a [Payload Collection Config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections).

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  searchPlugin({
    searchOverrides: {
      slug: 'search-results',
    },
  }),
}
```

#### `beforeSync`

An [afterChange](<[afterChange](https://payloadcms.com/docs/hooks/globals#afterchange)>) hook that is called before creating or syncing the document to search. This allows you to modify the data in any way before doing so.

```ts
// payload.config.ts
{
  // ...
  searchPlugin({
    beforeSync: ({ originalDoc, searchDoc }) => ({
      ...searchDoc,
      // Modify your docs in any way here, this can be async
      excerpt: originalDoc?.excerpt || 'This is a fallback excerpt',
    }),
  }),
}
```

#### `syncDrafts`

If true, will sync draft documents to search. By default, this plugin will only sync published documents. False by default. You must have [Payload Drafts](https://payloadcms.com/docs/versions/drafts) enabled for this to apply.

#### `deleteDrafts`

If true, will delete documents from search that change to draft status. True by default. You must have [Payload Drafts](https://payloadcms.com/docs/versions/drafts) enabled for this to apply.

## TypeScript

All types can be directly imported:

```ts
import { SearchConfig, BeforeSync } from '@payloadcms/plugin-search/dist/types'
```
