Payload CMS collects **completely anonymous** telemetry data about general usage. Participation in this is completely optional and can be opted out of.

## Why Is Data Being Collected?

Payload CMS actively engages with the community to gather feedback from users. However, this feedback is only from a small subset of total Payload users and possible use-cases. By adding telemetry data, we will be able to better serve _all of our users_, as it will ensure the right improvements are being made to continue making Payload CMS the best headless CMS solution out there.

## What Is Being Collected?

We track general usage of Payload CMS. Specifically, we track the following **completely anonymously**:

- Payload Version
- Node Version
- Anonymized IDs

  All values sent to use are <strong>totally anonymous</strong> and are one-way hashed with your own secret. This ensures we are unable to decrypt anything on our end.

## How Do I Opt-Out?

If you are able, leaving telemetry on helps us get a broader picture on Payload's usage and ensures that we continue to make the right improvements to Payload.

If you decide to opt-out, setting `telemetry: false` inside of your Payload config will disable all telemetry.

Further privacy-related information can be found in our [privacy policy](/privacy).
