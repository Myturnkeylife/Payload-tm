Hooks allow you to execute your own logic during specific events of the Document lifecycle. With Hooks, you can transform Payload from a traditional CMS into a fully-fledged application framework. They allow you to perform business tasks, third-party integrations, etc. during precise moments within the data lifecycle.

There are many use cases for Hooks, including:

- Integrate user profiles with a third-party CRM such as Salesforce or Hubspot
- Send a copy of uploaded files to Amazon S3 or similar
- Automatically add `lastModifiedBy` data to a document to track who has changed what over time
- Encrypt a field's data when it's saved and decrypt it when it's read
- Send emails when `ContactSubmission`s are created from a public website
- Integrate with a payment provider like Stripe to automatically process payments when an `Order` is created
- Securely recalculate order prices on the backend to ensure that the total price for `Order`s that users submit is accurate and valid
- Generate and store a `lastLoggedIn` date on a user by adding an `afterLogin` hook
- Add extra data to documents before they are read such as "average scores" or similar data that needs to be calculated on the fly

There are three main types of Hooks in Payload:

- [Collection Hooks](/docs/hooks/collections)
- [Global Hooks](/docs/hooks/globals)
- [Field Hooks](/docs/hooks/fields)

  <strong>Reminder:</strong>
  Payload also ships a set of _React_ hooks that you can use in your frontend application. Although they share a common name, these are very different things and should not be confused. [More details](../admin.hooks).

## Async vs. synchronous

All Hooks can be written as either synchronous or asynchronous functions. If the Hook should modify data before a document is updated or created, and it relies on asynchronous actions such as fetching data from a third party, it might make sense to define your Hook as an asynchronous function. This way you can be sure that your Hook completes before the operation's lifecycle continues. Async hooks are run in series - so if you have two async hooks defined, the second hook will wait for the first to complete before it starts.

If your Hook simply performs a side-effect, such as updating a CRM, it might be okay to define it synchronously, so the Payload operation does not have to wait for your hook to complete.

## Server-only execution

Hooks are only triggered on the server and are automatically excluded from the client-side bundle. This means that you can safely use sensitive business logic in your Hooks without worrying about exposing it to the client.
