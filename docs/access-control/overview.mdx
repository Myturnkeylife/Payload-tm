<YouTube id="DoPLyXG26Dg" title="Overview of Payload Access Control" />

Access Control determines what a user can and cannot do with any given Document, as well as what they can and cannot see within the [Admin Panel](../admin/overview). By implementing Access Control, you can define granular restrictions based on the user, their roles (RBAC), Document data, or any other criteria your application requires.

Access Control functions are scoped to the _operation_, meaning you can have different rules for `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, etc. Access Control can ether be defined on the Document itself, or on a field-by-field basis.

There are many use cases for Access Control, including:

- Allowing anyone `read` access to all `Post`s
- Only allowing public access to `Post`s where a `status` field is equal to `published`
- Giving only `User`s with a `role` field equal to `admin` the ability to delete `Page`(s)
- Allowing anyone to create `ContactSubmission`s, but only logged in users to `read`, `update` or `delete` them
- Restricting a `User` to only be able to see their own `Order`(s), but no others
- Allowing `User`s that belong to a certain `Organization` to access only that `Organization`'s `Resource`s

There are three main types of Access Control in Payload:

- [Collection Access Control](./collections)
- [Global Access Control](./globals)
- [Field Access Control](./fields)

## Default Access Control

Payload provides default Access Control so that your data is secured behind [Authentication](../authentication) without additional configuration. To do this, Payload sets a default function that simply checks if a user is present on the request. You can override this default behavior by defining your own Access Control functions as needed.

Here is the default Access Control that Payload provides:

```ts
const defaultPayloadAccess = ({ req: { user } }) => {
  // Return `true` if a user is found
  // and `false` if it is undefined or null
  return Boolean(user) // highlight-line
}
```

  <strong>Important:</strong>
  In the [Local API](../local-api/overview), all Access Control is _skipped_ by default. This allows your server to have full control over your application. To opt back in, you can set the `overrideAccess` option to `false` in your requests.

## When Access Control is Executed

Access control functions are utilized in both the Admin UI and the API. Here is a breakdown of when they are executed:

### As you execute operations

When you perform Payload operations like `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`, your Access Control functions will be executed _before_ any changes are made or operations are completed.

### Within the Admin UI

The Payload Admin UI responds dynamically to the access control that you define. For example, if you restrict editing a `ExampleCollection` to only users that feature a `role` of `admin`, the Payload Admin UI will **hide** the `ExampleCollection` from the Admin UI entirely. This is super powerful and allows you to control who can do what with your Admin UI.

To accomplish this, Payload ships with an `Access` operation, which is executed when a user logs into the Admin UI. Payload will execute each one of your access control functions, across all collections, globals, and fields, at the top level and return a response that contains a reflection of what the currently authenticated user can do with your application.

## Argument Availability

  <strong>Important:</strong>
  <br />
  When your access control functions are executed via the <strong>access</strong> operation, the{' '}
  <strong>id</strong> and <strong>data</strong> arguments will be <strong>undefined</strong>,
  because Payload is executing your functions without referencing a specific document.

If you use `id` or `data` within your access control functions, make sure to check that they are defined first. If they are not, then you can assume that your access control is being executed via the `access` operation, to determine solely what the user can do within the Admin UI.
