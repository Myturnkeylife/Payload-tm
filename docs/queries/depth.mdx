Documents in Payload can have relationships to other Documents. This is true for both [Collections](../configuration/collections) as well as [Globals](../configuration/globals). When you query a Document, you can specify the depth at which to populate any of its related Documents as full objects, or simply return their Document IDs.

Depth will optimize the performance of your application by limiting the number of queries made to the database, and significantly reducing the amount of data returned. Since Documents can be infinitely nested or recursively related, it's important to be able to control how deep your API populate.

When you specify a `depth` of `0`, for example, the API response might look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832",
  "title": "This is a great post",
  "author": "5f7dd05cd50d4005f8bcab17"
}
```

But with a `depth` of `1`, the response might look like this:

```json
{
  "id": "5ae8f9bde69e394e717c8832",
  "title": "This is a great post",
  "author": {
    "id": "5f7dd05cd50d4005f8bcab17",
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

  <strong>Important:</strong>
  Depth has no effect in the [GraphQL API](../graphql/overview), because there, depth is based on the shape of your queries.
</Banner>

## Local API

To specify depth in the [Local API](../local-api/overview), you can use the `depth` option in your query:

```ts
const getPosts = async () => {
  const posts = await payload.find({
    collection: 'posts',
    depth: 2, // highlight-line
  })

  return posts
}
```

<Banner type="info">
  <strong>Reminder:</strong>
  This is the same for [Globals](../configuration/globals) using the `findGlobal` operation.
</Banner>

## REST API

To specify depth in the [REST API](../rest-api/overview), you can use the `depth` parameter in your query:

```ts
fetch('https://localhost:3000/api/posts?depth=2') // highlight-line
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => console.log(data))
```

<Banner type="info">
  <strong>Reminder:</strong>
  This is the same for [Globals](../configuration/globals) using the `/api/globals` endpoint.
</Banner>

## Max Depth

Fields like [`relationship`](../fields/relationship) or [`upload`](../fields/upload) can set a maximum depth that limits the population despite the depth parameter in the query. If the current depth when the field is accessed exceeds the `maxDepth`, the field will not be populated.

To set a max depth for a field, use the `maxDepth` property in your field configuration:

```js
{
  slug: 'posts',
  fields: [
    {
      name: 'author',
      type: 'relationship',
      relationTo: 'users',
      maxDepth: 2, // highlight-line
    }
  ]
}
```
