Payload `find` queries support a `sort` parameter through all APIs. Pass the `name` of a top-level field to sort by that field in ascending order. Prefix the name of the field with a minus symbol ("-") to sort in descending order.

Because sorting is handled by the database, the field you wish to sort on must be stored in the database to work; not a [virtual field](https://payloadcms.com/blog/learn-how-virtual-fields-can-help-solve-common-cms-challenges). It is recommended to enable indexing for the fields where sorting is used.

## Local API

```js
const getPosts = async () => {
  const posts = await payload.find({
    collection: 'posts',
    sort: '-createdAt',
  })

  return posts
}
```

## REST API

**`https://localhost:3000/api/posts?sort=-createdAt`**

## GraphQL API

```ts
query {
  Posts(sort: "-createdAt") {
    docs {
      color
    }
  }
}
```
